# Downloads Editions

This project is an experiment in scripting the creation of a book, where each edition is generated from the contents of download foldersâ€”a space where the web meets the local directory and files often go to be forgotten. Each edition reflects on the digital clutter that accumulates over time, revealing the hidden stories in the files we download.

To contribute to future editions, download the provided script and run it on your computer. The script will automatically generate a book from your download folder. Once complete, you can submit your book for inclusion in the collective archive of editions, adding your own chapter to this ongoing exploration of digital archives.
