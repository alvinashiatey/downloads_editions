# Downloads Editions

This is an experiment in scripting an edition of a book. This initial version looks into the famous, infamous download folders. The idea is to create a book that is a collection of files from the download folders. Randomly selected files are used to create the book. The book is then published as a PDF file on the web.

If you want to contribute to this edition, download the script and run it on your computer. The script will create a book from your download folder. You can then send the book to me, and I will add it to the collection.
