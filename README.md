# Downloads Editions

This project experiments with scripting the creation of a book—each edition generated directly from the contents of a download folder, a crossroads where the web meets local files that might otherwise be forgotten. Each edition reflects on the digital clutter accumulating over time, revealing the hidden stories within our downloads.

To contribute to future editions, simply download the provided script and run it on your computer. The script automates the generation of a book from your download folder. Once completed, you can submit your book for inclusion in the collective archive of editions, adding your own chapter to this ongoing exploration of digital archives.
