# Downloads Editions

This project is an experiment in scripting the creation of a book, where each edition is generated from the contents of download foldersâ€”a space where the web meets the local directory and also the directory where files go to be forgotten. The process randomly selects files from the download folder to assemble a unique book. Once generated, each edition is published as a PDF and made available online.

To contribute, download the provided script and run it on your computer. The script will automatically generate a book from your download folder. Once complete, you can submit your book to me for inclusion in the collective archive of editions.
